# dhcp-stats-prometheus
Prometheus exporter for DHCP stats, uses dhcpd-pools to fetch stats. I have included a pre-built dhcpd-pools with the package but nothing stops you from compiling your own version yourself.

You may acquire dhcpd-pools from http://dhcpd-pools.sourceforge.net/ for your own compiling needs. Debian stretch also seems to include a version of dhcpd-pools.
